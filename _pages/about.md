I am currently a Ph.D. student and member of Bilkent Information Retrieval Group (BilIR) at Bilkent University. I am working under the supervision of Prof. FazlÄ± Can. I obtained my M.S. degree in computer engineering from Bilkent University in 2021 and my B.S. degree in computer software engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) in 2018. During my Master's, I worked on the design and implementation of a neural network architecture for handling concept drift in evolving text streams. My B.S. thesis was entitled "Driver Drowsiness Detection using RaspberryPi" and supervised by Prof. Behrouz Minaei. My research interests include Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, Data mining and Natural Language processing.
