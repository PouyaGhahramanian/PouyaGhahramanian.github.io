I am currently a master's student and member of Bilkent Information Retrieval Group (BilIR) at Bilkent University. I am working under the supervision of Prof. FazlÄ± Can. I obtained my B.S. degree in computer software engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) in 2018. My B.S. thesis was entitled "Driver Drowsiness Detection using RaspberryPi" and supervised by Prof. Behrouz Minaei. My research interests include Machine Learning, Data mining, Natural Language processing, and Artificial Intelligence in general.
